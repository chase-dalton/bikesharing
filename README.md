# bikesharing

## Overview
The customer is trying to determine if it's worth opening a bike-sharing program in Des Moines. While Des Moines isn't New York, an analysis of NYC bike-sharing data can help identify trends that can be useful when debating investment into a new location. The results can be found [here](https://public.tableau.com/views/NYCCitibikeChallenge_16318312213130/NYCCitiBikeChallenge?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)

## Results
With the help of Tableau, we were able to identify that:

![total](https://github.com/typicalchazz/bikesharing/blob/main/Images/Total.png)
- There were 2,344,224 people using the bike-sharing bikes in August of 2019.

![gender breakdown](https://github.com/typicalchazz/bikesharing/blob/main/Images/Gender_Breakdown.png)
- Of those, the vast majority were male, 1,530,272, while 588,431 were female, and 225,521 were unknown.

![duration](https://github.com/typicalchazz/bikesharing/blob/main/Images/Tripduration.png)
- The vast majority of bikes are ridden for less than an hour, with a peak trip duration of 5 minutes.

![gduration](https://github.com/typicalchazz/bikesharing/blob/main/Images/Gender_Tripduration.png)
- Trip duration trends are very similar between male and female, with men having a peak trip duration of 5 minutes while women have a 6-minute peak.

![time](https://github.com/typicalchazz/bikesharing/blob/main/Images/Time.png)
- Thursdays from 5:00 PM to 6:00 PM is the most popular trip day/time.

![gtime](https://github.com/typicalchazz/bikesharing/blob/main/Images/Gender_Time.png)
- Men and women ride have similar trends when it comes to popular trip times, with most rides being in the morning from 7:00 AM to 9:00 AM and in the evening from 5:00 PM to 7:00 PM.

![sub](https://github.com/typicalchazz/bikesharing/blob/main/Images/Subscriber.png)
- The majority of subscribers are male. 

## Summary
Analyzing the data in Tableau has revealed some interesting information. The main takeaway from the data would be that the vast majority of rides in New York are done by men during morning and evening rush hours. We can infer that this is likely due to the bikes being used as an alternate to public/private transportation to and from work. It would be beneficial to have other analyses to determine if the NYC bike-sharing model could be viable in Des Moines, such as comparing different months to see if August's trends are year-round trends, or to compare the bike data to weather data to see how weather affects trends.
